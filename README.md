# Frontend Task - STT Dashboard
This is a frontend dashboard built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** . It includes basic authentication, settings update, and user data handling via a local JSON file.

## Features
- Login & Signup
- Profile update with real-time data reflection
- JSON-based data handling (no database)
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- Basic admin dashboard setup
  
##  Dark Mode Status
 **Note:** Dark mode is **partially implemented**. Currently, it only applies to the **right side scrollbar** of the application.  
Full dark mode support (background, text, components) is still a work in progress.
